# London House Prices Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the London house prices dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objectives are to explore the dataset and visualize trends and patterns related to house prices in various locations across London. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to gain an understanding of the housing market in London.

### Data Sources

Housing Data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "London_House_prices.csv" containing information about the various house listings in London and neighbouring region

### Data Cleaning / Preparation

In the initial Data Cleaning phase we performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection 
- Handled missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the housing data to answer questions such as : 

- What is the Average House in London?
- What are the most expensive areas of London?
- What are the cheapest areas of London?

### Results / Findings 

#### The average house in London

We used the built in describe funtion of Pandas to take a look at our features and we found out that the average size of houses in london is 1712sqft and they have on average three bedrooms and three bathrooms.

If we plot the area of the houses in a graph we can see it more clearly with our mean value lying around the 1700sqft area

When we look at the distribution of houses by number of bedrooms we can see that the majority of houses typically have 2 bedrooms, with 3-bedroom houses being the second most common. Following closely are houses with 4 bedrooms. Conversely, houses with 8, 9, or 10 bedrooms are much less frequent, and their percentages are relatively similar, suggesting a scarcity of larger houses in this dataset.
